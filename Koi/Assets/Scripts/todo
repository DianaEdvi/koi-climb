bugs 
- cant figure out how to flip sprites when you rotate the other way 
- 

todo
- import controller settings 
- change dragon to transform the level into a shooter game where the player needs to kill all the mobs before the time runs out 
- and the circle fireballs are a pickup they can get (consistently! no rng, but still a challenge somehow) 
- implement respawn mechanic to actually work when you press r 
- i think you should make the shooter an optional collectible in the level (that appears only once but has multiple collection points if missed) 
- set as many respawns as you want, though. hold respawn for 3s to reset it to the beginning of the level
- if you get stuck in a respawn, respawn to the nearest safe zone

- end screen after level: food caught, enemies killed, respawned used, koi fish rating
